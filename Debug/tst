In that case, the interface should say something about memory management. I say "should" because it might not - some interfaces are poorly specified, fact of life. Whenever you return a pointer from a function, you need to say who is responsible for allocating the data that's pointed to, how long it remains valid, and who is responsible for freeing it (if applicable). If you can work that out, you can figure out how to return an appropriate pointer value.
